## React Native is...
### A JavaScript framework
- Built on top of React.js
- That produces native mobile apps 
- Using native components
- Performance

#### Benefits

1. Cross Platform - Target iOS and Android with same code
2. Dynamic Updates - Update apps in matter of seconds
3. Hybrid Apps - Combine native components and apps with React Native

#### Developer Tooling and Workflow

1. Familiar - Friendly and familiar to web developers
2. Lightning Quick - Between making a change in code and seeing it on a screen
3. Out of the Box - Minimal setup required to get started

#### Community and Ecosystem

1. Massive Community - Loads of overlap with the React community
2. NPM - millions of packages, you can use NPM packages in your app
3. Get Unstuck - Loads of people to help you out when you get stuck

#### Traditional Approach

| Targeting iOS | Targeting Android |
|---------------|-------------------|
|Swift or Obj-C |Java or Kotlin     |

The challenge with this approach is quite obvious, you'll need to duplicate your efforts and costs, when going with this route, twice the cost of ownership to develop for both platforms.

#### Other frameworks

1. Ionic 
2. Xamarin
3. PureScript
4. Flutter

#### Overview

1. You write JSX that compiles to plain JS package using Webpack
2. Load JS in JavaScriptCore where it executes it, render native components

#### Installation

1. NodeJS - latest version
2. Visual Studio code - code editor
3. Git

#### Configuring your environment

```

```console
jaydeepvomex@MacBookPro:~$ create-react-native-app AppName
```
